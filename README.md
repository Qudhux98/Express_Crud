# CRUD operation with Expressjs

1. CRUD is an acronym for "Create", "Read", "Update" and "Delete".
2. This tests your understanding in working with APIs (Application Programming Interface).
3. In this module, I created an API for for the CRUD funtion with POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE.
4. This APIs create, get, update, and delete User or Todo list application respectively.
5. This means you can add a new user or get all or any available user, update an existing user's details or delete user.
6. You can also add a new todo list or get all or any available Todo list, update an existing todo list or delete todo list.

# Login System

1. Just as we know that the integration of sign-up and login sytem is neccessary for any website that interacts with clients.
2. This is to avoid spammers and bots ensuring that it really dealing with human beign.
3. The sign-up detail usually contains inputs like name, email, password.
4. I upadted this module to include sign-up and login system where by users have to sign-in with their correct emails and passwords.

# Getting all the todo lists by a particular user

1. In this lesson, todo lists are linked to the users and created an API to get todo lists by userId.
2. This means todo lists are created by different users and each user can get their todo list.
3. This gives us the sense of how a notepad on phones work in a real life scenario.
